\maketitle

The phenomenon of \textit{cellular automata} is a well studied topic in mathematics that can be used to model interactions between discrete ``cells'' in a number of disciplines.
In physics the concept has been used in the creation of theoretical models of reality, in which the universe is conceived of as composed of individual cells effected by their neighbors.
Gas and fluid dynamics, too, can be modeled using this concept, leading to simulations that can be used to study the interactions of particles.
My automata sculptures embody the concept in by producing and displaying the interactions of cells.
It is conceptually important that the sculptures not be a predetermined set of states, but be the natural product of the interaction of the individual cells.
By creating individual cells in communication with each other, my sculptures become authentic and aesthetic monuments to the beauty and importance of this phenomenon.
